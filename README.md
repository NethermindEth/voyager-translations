# Voyager Translations

## Simple How to translate

- Checkout to a new branch for your locale say `git checkout -b hi`
- Make a copy of folder `en` and rename it as new locale e.g `hi`
- Translate all or keys which are required in file `translation.json` which should be inside `YOUR_LOCALE/translation.json`
- Once done, commit you changes push to the branch and make a PR to `main` branch.

## Guidelines for creating new keys:
